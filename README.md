## 👦 **About me**
I'm a 22 year old Brazilian computer engineering student. I've been working with technology since 2020 and during that period of my professional life I worked on some fullstack projects.

I have two main **goals**:

**My first one** is to hone my skills as a software developer to become the best developer i can be. I have a great desire to learn and work with new technologies.

**My second one** is to use these technologies to positively impact the world, whether by automating a process, creating an application, or simply keeping a legacy system running.
